For example, using face recognition technology to profile individuals allows someone to search for you more easily. Facebook uses several sneaky techniques to track what webpages you visit outside of Facebook to squeeze more information out from you. Facebook also recently settled a class-action lawsuit because they \"collected and stored the biometric data of Facebook users in Illinois without the proper notice and consent in violation of Illinois law.\" These things happen all the time, and if we have a right to own our private information, you could argue that we have lost that right.

    "A company merely storing and collecting your data is not a reason to worry. After all, there is a minimum amount of information any person would need to provide you a service. However, when this information is used to manipulate our behavior, it should be concerning. AI systems allow this kind of manipulation to be automated on a larger scale than was possible before. For example, distributing targeted political propaganda on social media to influence voters. Out of the growing number of examples of this practice, the Nancy Pelosi deepfake is one of the more famous. It portrayed her as intoxicated and sparked outrage on the internet. However, that video was manipulated and debunked by several news outlets. "
